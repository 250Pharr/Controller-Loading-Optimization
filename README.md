# Controller-Loading-Optimization

Code to organize a complex DeltaV network.  Uses FHXtools to extract data from a full DeltaV fhx to be fed into an optimization algorithm.  The algorithm will then generate optimal node assignments within CIOC to Controller constraints and load balancing controllers
